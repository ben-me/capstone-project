You are an employee working in a shared desk/co-working office space and want to plan upcoming days in the office?

DeskShare helps you pick a room, check the availability of the desks and allows you to book a reservation.

You can easily plan ahead, know exactly when and where you will work on a given day and have an easy to manage overview of all your reservations.

Don't want to or can't work on a day on which you already reserverd a desk? No problem! Easily check and delete your reservations with a few simple clicks.
